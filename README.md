## Update

Kive was designed as a tool for a larger suite of tools to increase user productivity. However, due to the sheer efficency of [Dtrx](https://github.com/brettcs/dtrx), there will no longer be expected updates to this project.

## Kive

Command line automatic multi-format compression/decompression & archiving/unarchiving utility.
Supports auto-detection as well as manual input.

## Prerequisites

Kive is built on Golang, it is thus mandatory to have support for GoLang installed on your machine. Running the following command will install the kive module on your system.

```
go get github.com/strixsc/kive
```

## Usage

Kive is made to allow users to extract or decompress files without having to remember tacky command line flags or worrying about the file extension.

Thus the typical usage would be: 

```bash
kive auto <INPUT FILE>
```
